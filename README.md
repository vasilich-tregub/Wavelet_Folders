# Wavelet_Folders
This repository starts a series of projects to help me (and supposedly other people) learn the internals of modern video codes.

The first project in the series is bassed off Tim Cogan's blog post  LeGall-Tabatabai wavelet transform (https://tim.cogan.dev/lgt-wavelet/).

I tool the liberty of making minor corrections to the code of this post.
